<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>WITCHCRAFT IN SOMERSETSHIRE.</h3>

  <p>Perhaps the following account of superstitions now entertained in some
  parts of Somersetshire, will be interesting to the inquirers into the
  history of witchcraft. I was lately informed by a member of my
  congregation that two children living near his house were bewitched. I
  made inquiries into the matter, and found that witchcraft is by far less
  uncommon than I had imagined. I can hardly adduce the two children as an
  authenticated case, because the medical gentleman who attended them
  pronounced their illness to be a kind of ague: but I leave the two
  following cases on record in "N. &amp; Q." as memorable instances of
  witchcraft in the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>A cottager, who does not live five minutes' walk from my house, found
  his pig seized with a strange and unaccountable disorder. He, being a
  sensible man, instead of asking the advice of a veterinary surgeon,
  immediately went to the white witch (a gentleman who drives a flourishing
  trade in this neighbourhood). He received his directions, and went home
  and implicitly followed them. In perfect silence, he went to the pigsty;
  and lancing each foot and both ears of the pig, he allowed the blood to
  run into a piece of common dowlas. Then taking two large pins, he pierced
  the dowlas in opposite directions; and still keeping silence, entered his
  cottage, locked the door, placed the bloody rag upon the fire, heaped up
  some turf over it, and reading a few verses of the Bible, waited till the
  dowlas was burned. As soon as this was done, he returned to the pigsty;
  found his pig perfectly restored to health, and, <i>mirabile dictu!</i>
  as the white witch had predicted, the old woman, who it was supposed had
  bewitched the pig, came to inquire after the pig's health. The animal
  never suffered a day's illness afterwards. My informant was the owner of
  the pig himself.</p>

  <p>Perhaps, when I heard this story, there may have been a lurking
  expression of doubt upon my face, so that my friend thought it necessary
  to give me farther proof. Some time ago a lane in this town began to be
  looked upon with a mysterious awe, for every evening a strange white
  rabbit <!-- Page 614 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page614"></a>{614}</span> would appear in it, and, running up and
  down, would mysteriously disappear. Dogs were frequently put on the
  scent, but all to no purpose, the white rabbit could not be caught; and
  rumours soon began to assert pretty confidently, that the white rabbit
  was nothing more nor less than a witch. The man whose pig had been
  bewitched was all the more confident; as every evening when the rabbit
  appeared, he had noticed the bed-room window of his old enemy's house
  open! At last a large party of bold-hearted men one evening were
  successful enough to find the white rabbit in a garden, the only egress
  from which is through a narrow passage between two cottages, all the rest
  of the garden being securely surrounded by brick-walls. They placed a
  strong guard in this entry to let nothing pass, while the remainder
  advanced as skirmishers among the cabbages: one of these was successful,
  and caught the white rabbit by the ears, and, not without some
  trepidation, carried it towards the reserve in the entry. But, as he came
  nearer to his friends, his courage grew; and gradually all the wrongs his
  poor pig had suffered, took form and vigour in a powerful kick at the
  poor little rabbit! No sooner had he done this than, he cannot tell how,
  the rabbit was out of his grasp; the people in the entry saw it come, but
  could not stop it; through them all it went, and has never been seen
  again. But now to the proof of the witchcraft. The old woman, whom all
  suspected, was laid up in her bed for three days afterwards, unable to
  walk about: all in consequence of the kick she had received in the shape
  of a white rabbit!</p>

<h3>"EMBLEMATA HORATIANA."</h3>

  <p>Whatever may be proposed as to republishing works of English emblems,
  the work published in Holland with the above title at all events deserves
  to be better known. All the English works on the subject I ever saw, are
  poor indeed compared with the above: indeed, I think most books of
  emblems are either grounded or compiled from this interesting work; which
  is to the artist a work of the deepest interest, since all the designs
  are by Otho Venius, the master of Rubens. Not only are the morals
  conveyed lofty and sound, but the figures are first-rate specimens of
  drawing. I believe it is this work that Malone says Sir Joshua Reynolds
  learned to draw from: and if he really did, he could have had nothing
  better, whatever age he might be. "His principal fund of imitation," says
  Malone, "was Jacob Cat's book of emblems, which his great-grandmother, by
  his father's side, who was a Dutch woman, had brought with her from
  Holland." There is a small copy I think published in England, but a very
  poor one: the original work, of which I possess a portion only, is large,
  and engraved with great care. And I have often thought it a pity such an
  admirable work should be so scarce and little known. Whoever did it, it
  must have occupied many years, in those slow days, to make the designs
  and engrave them. At the present day lithography, or some of the easy
  modes of engraving, would soon multiply it. The size of the engravings
  are rather more than seven inches. Many of the figures have been used
  repeatedly by Rubens, and also some of the compositions. And though he is
  certainly a better painter, he falls far short in originality compared
  with his master; and, I may add, in richness of material. I should say
  his chief works are to be found in that book. One of my leaves is
  numbered 195: so I should judge the work to be very large, and to embrace
  a variety of subjects. Some of the figures are worthy of Raffaelle. I may
  instance one called the "Balance of Friendship." Two young men have a
  balance between them; one side is filled with feathers, and the other
  with weightier offerings: the meaning being, we should not allow favours
  and gifts to come all from one side. The figures have their hands joined,
  and appear to be in argument: their ample drapery is worthy of a study
  for apostles.</p>

  <p>"Undertake nothing beyond your Strength" is emblemised by the giants
  scaling the heavens: one very fine figure, full of action, in the centre,
  is most admirably drawn.</p>

  <p>"Education and Habit" is another, full of meaning. Two dogs are
  running: one after game, and another to a porringer. Some one has
  translated the verses at the bottom on the back of the print as follows.
  This has a fine group of figures in it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When taught by man, the hound pursues</p>
      <p class="i1">The panting stag o'er hill and fell,</p>
      <p>With steadfast eyes he keeps in view</p>
      <p class="i1">The noble game he loves so well.</p>
      <p>A mongrel coward slinks away,</p>
      <p class="i1">The buck, the chase, ne'er warms his soul;</p>
      <p>No huntsman's cheer can make him stay,</p>
      <p class="i1">He runs to nothing, but his porridge bowl.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Throughout the race of men, 'tis still the same,</p>
      <p>And all pursue a different kind of game.</p>
      <p>Taverns and wine will form the tastes of some,</p>
      <p>Others success in maids or wives undone.</p>
      <p>To solid good, the wise pursues his way;</p>
      <p>Nor for low pleasure ever deigns to stay.</p>
      <p>Though in thy chamber all the live-long day,</p>
      <p>In studious mood, you pass the hours away;</p>
      <p>Or though you pace the noisy streets alone,</p>
      <p>And silent watch day's burning orb go down;</p>
      <p><i>Nature</i> to thee displays her honest page:</p>
      <p>Read there&mdash;and see the follies of an age."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The taste for emblemata appears to have passed by, but a good

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CRITICISM.</h3>

  <p>When I entered on the game of criticism in "N. &amp; Q.," I deemed
  that it was to be played with good humour, in the spirit of courtesy and
  urbanity, and that, consequently, though there might be much worthless
  criticism and conjecture, the result would on the whole be profitable.
  Finding that such is not to be the case, I retire from the field, and
  will trouble "N. &amp; Q." with no more of my lucubrations.</p>

  <p>I have been led to this resolution by the language employed by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span> in No. 189., where, with little modesty,
  and less courtesy, he styles the commentators on Shakspeare&mdash;naming
  in particular, <span class="sc">Knight</span>, <span
  class="sc">Collier</span>, and <span class="sc">Dyce</span>, and
  including <span class="sc">Singer</span> and all of the present
  day&mdash;<i>criticasters</i> who "stumble and bungle in sentences of
  that simplicity and grammatical clearness as not to tax the powers of a
  third-form schoolboy to explain." In order to bring <i>me</i> "within his
  danger," he actually transposes two lines of Shakspeare; and so, to the
  unwary, makes me appear to be a very shallow person indeed.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"It was gravely," says Mr. A., "almost magisterially, proposed by one
  of the disputants [<span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>] to corrupt the
  concluding lines by altering <i>their</i> the pronoun into <i>there</i>
  the adverb, because (shade of Murray!) the commentator could not discover
  of what noun <i>their</i> could possibly be the pronoun, in these lines
  following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'When great things labouring perish in their birth,</p>
      <p>Their form confounded makes most form in mirth;'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and it was left to <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley</span> to bless the
  world with the information that it was <i>things</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In all the modern editions that I have been able to consult, these
  lines are thus printed and punctuated:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Their form confounded makes most form in mirth;</p>
      <p>When great things labouring perish in the birth:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and <i>their</i> is referred to <i>contents</i>. I certainly seem to
  have been the first to refer it to <i>things</i>.</p>

  <p>Allow me, as it is my last, to give once more the whole passage as it
  is in the folios, unaltered by <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>'s
  Magnus Apollo, and with my own punctuation:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"That sport best pleases, that doth least know how,</p>
      <p>Where zeal strives to content, and the contents</p>
      <p>Dyes in the zeal of that which it presents.</p>
      <p>Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,</p>
      <p>When great things labouring perish in the birth."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, Act V. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>My interpretation, it will be seen, beside referring <i>their</i> to
  <i>things</i>, makes <i>dyes in</i> signify <i>tinges</i>, <i>imbues
  with</i>; of which use of the expression I now offer the following
  instances:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And the grey ocean <i>into purple dye</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Faery Queene</i>, ii. 10. 48.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Dyed in</i> the dying <i>slaughter</i> of their foes."</p>

  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And it was <i>dyed in mummy</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Othello</i>, Act III. Sc. 4.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O truant Muse! what shall be thy amends</p>
      <p>For thy neglect of truth <i>in beauty dyed</i>?"</p>
      <p class="i8">Sonn. 101.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>For the use of this figure I may quote from the Shakspeare of
  France:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Mais pour moi, qui, caché sous une autre aventure,</p>
      <p>D'une âme plus commune ai pris quelque <i>teinture</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Héraclius</i>, Act III. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>

  <p>"The house ought to <i>dye</i> all the surrounding country with a
  strength of colouring, and to an extent proportioned to its own
  importance."&mdash;<i>Life of Wordsworth</i>, i. 355.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another place on which I had offered a conjecture, and which <span
  class="sc">Mr. A.</span> takes under his patronage, is "Clamor your
  tongues" (<i>Winter's Tale</i>, Act IV. Sc. 4.) and in proof of
  <i>clamor</i> being the right word, he quotes passages from a book
  printed in 1542, in which are <i>chaumbreed</i> and <i>chaumbre</i>, in
  the sense of restraining. I see little resemblance here to <i>clamor</i>,
  and he does not say that he would substitute <i>chaumbre</i>. He says,
  "Most judiciously does Nares reject Gifford's corruption of this word
  into <i>charm</i> [it was Grey not Gifford]; nor will the suffrage of the
  'clever' old commentator," &amp;c. It is very curious, only that we
  <i>criticasters</i> are so apt to overrun our game, that the only place
  where "charm your tongue" really occurs, seems to have escaped <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>. In <i>Othello</i>, Act V. Sc. 2., Iago
  says to his wife, "Go to, charm your tongue;" and she replies, "I will
  not charm my tongue." My conjecture was that <i>clamor</i> was
  <i>clam</i>, or, as it was usually spelt, <i>clem</i>, to press or
  restrain; and to this I still adhere.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"When my entrails</p>
      <p>Were <i>clemmed</i> with keeping a perpetual fast."</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I cannot eat stones and turfs: say, what will he <i>clem</i> me and
  my followers?"&mdash;Jonson, <i>Poetaster</i>, Act I. Sc. 2.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Hard is the choice when the valiant must eat their arms or
  <i>clem</i>." Id., <i>Every Man Out of his Humour</i> Act III. Sc. 6.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In these places of Jonson, <i>clem</i> is usually rendered
  <i>starve</i>; but it appears to me, from the kindred of the term, that
  it is used elliptically. Perhaps, instead of "Till famine <i>cling</i>
  thee" (<i>Macbeth</i>, Act V. Sc. 5.), Shakspeare wrote "Till <!-- Page
  616 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page616"></a>{616}</span> famine
  <i>clem</i> thee." While in the region of conjecture, I will add that
  <i>coasting</i>, in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> (Act IV. Sc. 5.), is, in
  my opinion, simply accosting, lopped in the usual way by aphæresis; and
  that "the still-peering air" in <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i> (Act
  III. Sc. 2.), is, by the same figure, "the still-appearing air,"
  <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the air that appears still and silent, but that yet
  "<i>sings</i> with piercing."</p>

  <p>One conjecture more, and I have done. I do not like altering the text
  without absolute necessity; but there was always a puzzle to me in this
  passage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"Where I find him, were it</p>
      <p>At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,</p>
      <p>Against the hospitable canon, would I</p>
      <p>Wash my fierce hand in 's blood."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Coriol.</i>, Act I. Sc. 10.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Why should Aufidius speak thus of a brother who is not mentioned
  anywhere else in the play or in Plutarch? It struck me one day that
  Shakspeare <i>might</i> have written, "Upon my household hearth;" and on
  looking into North's <i>Plutarch</i>, I found that when Coriolanus went
  to the house of Aufidius, "he got him up straight to <i>the
  chimney-hearth</i>, and sate him downe." The poet who adhered so
  faithfully to his <i>Plutarch</i> may have wished to preserve this image,
  and, <i>chimney</i> not being a very poetic word, may have substituted
  <i>household</i>, or some equivalent term. Again I say this is all but
  conjecture.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Thomas Keightley.</span>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;It is really very annoying to have to reply to unhandsome
  and unjust accusations. The <span class="sc">Rev. Mr. Arrowsmith</span>
  first transposes two lines of Shakspeare, and then, by notes of
  admiration, holds me up as a mere simpleton; and then A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. charges me
  with having pirated from him my explanation of a passage in <i>Love's
  Labour's Lost</i>, Act V. Sc. 2. Let any one compare his (in "N. &amp;
  Q.," Vol. vi., p. 297.) with mine (Vol. vii., p. 136.), and he will see
  the utter falseness of the assertion. <i>He</i> makes <i>contents</i> the
  nom. to <i>dies</i>, taken in its ordinary sense (rather an unusual
  concord). <i>I</i> take <i>dyes</i> in the sense of tinges, imbues with,
  and make it governed of <i>zeal</i>. But perhaps it is to the full-stop
  at <i>presents</i> that the "that's my thunder!" applies. I answer, that
  that was a necessary consequence of the sense in which I had taken
  <i>dies</i>, and that <i>their</i> must then refer to <i>things</i>
  maugre <span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span>. And when he says that I
  "do him the honour of requoting the line with which he had supported it,"
  I merely observe that it is the line immediately following, and that I
  have eyes and senses as well as A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.</p>

  <p>A. E. B. deceives himself, if he thinks that literary fame is to be
  acquired in this way. I do not much approve either of the manner in
  which, at least to my apprehension, in his opening paragraph, he seems to
  insinuate a charge of forgery against <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span>. Finally, I can tell him that he need not crow and clap
  his wings so much at his emendation of the passage in <i>Lear</i>, for,
  if I mistake not, few indeed will receive it. It may be nuts to him and
  <span class="sc">Mr. Arrowsmith</span> to know that they have succeeded
  in driving my name out of the "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<h3>RED HAIR A REPROACH.</h3>

  <p>I do not know the why or the wherefore, but in every part of England I
  have visited, there appears to be a deep-rooted prejudice in the eyes of
  the million against people with red hair. Tradition, whether truly or not
  must remain a mystery, assigns to Absalom's hair a reddish tinge; and
  Judas, the traitorous disciple, is ever painted with locks of the same
  unhappy colour. Shakspeare, too, seems to have been embued with the like
  morbid feeling of distrust for those on whose hapless heads the invidious
  mark appeared. In his play of <i>As You Like It</i>, he makes Rosalind
  (who is pettishly complaining of her lover's tardiness coming to her) say
  to Celia:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Ros.</i> His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</p>
      <p><i>Celia.</i> Something browner than Judas'."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It will be apparent from this quotation, that in England, at any rate,
  the prejudice spoken of is not of very recent development; and that it
  has not yet vanished before the intellectual progress of our race, will,
  I think, be painfully evident to many a bearer of this unenviable
  distinction. It seems to be generally supposed, by those who harbour the
  doctrine, that red-headed people are dissemblers, deceitful, and, in
  fact, not to be trusted like others whose hair is of a different colour;
  and I may add, that I myself know persons who, on that account alone,
  never admit into their service any whose hair is thus objectionable. In
  Wales, <i>pen coch</i> (red head) is a term of reproach universally
  applied to all who come under the category; and if such a wight should by
  any chance involve himself in a scrape, it is the signal at once for a
  regular tirade against all who have the misfortune to possess hair of the
  same fiery colour.</p>

  <p>I cannot bring myself to believe that there is any really valid
  foundation for this prejudice; and certainly, if not, it were indeed a
  pity that the superstitious feeling thus engendered is not at once and
  for ever banished from the memory.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Last Suicide buried at a Cross Road.</i>&mdash;I have reason to
  believe that the <i>last</i> person subjected to this barbarous ceremony
  was the wretched parricide and suicide Griffiths, who was buried at the
  cross road formed by Eaton Street, Grosvenor Place, and the King's Road,
  as late as June, 1823. I subjoin the following account from the
  <i>Chronicle</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The extreme privacy which the officers observed, as to the hour and
  place of interment, increased in a great degree the anxiety of those that
  were waiting, and it being suspected that the body would have been
  privately carried away, through the back part of the workhouse (St.
  George's) into Farm Street Mews, and from thence to its final
  destination, different parties stationed themselves at the several
  passages through which it must unavoidably pass, in order to prevent
  disappointment. All anxiety however, on this account, was ultimately
  removed, by preparations being made for the removal of the body through
  the principal entry of the workhouse leading into Mount Street, and about
  half-past one o'clock the body was brought out in a shell supported on
  the shoulders of four men, and followed by a party of constables and
  watchmen. The solitary procession, which increased in numbers as it went
  along, proceeded up Mount Street, down South Audley Street into Stanhope
  Street, from thence into Park Lane through Hyde Park Corner, and along
  Grosvenor Place, until its final arrival at the cross road formed by
  Eaton Street, Grosvenor Place, and the King's Road. When the procession
  arrived at the grave, which had been previously dug, the constables
  arranged themselves around it to keep the crowd off, upon which the shell
  was laid on the ground, and the body of the unfortunate deceased taken
  out. It had on a winding-sheet, drawers, and stockings, and a quantity of
  blood was clotted about the head, and the lining of the shell entirely
  stained. The body was then wrapped in a piece of Russia matting, tied
  round with some cord, and then instantly dropped into the hole, which was
  about five feet in depth: it was then immediately filled up, and it was
  gratifying to see that that disgusting part of the ceremony of throwing
  lime over the body, and driving a stake through it, was on this occasion
  dispensed with. The surrounding spectators, consisting of about two
  hundred persons, amongst whom were several persons of respectable
  appearance, were much disgusted at this horrid ceremony."</p>

  <p><i>Slang Expressions.</i>&mdash;It would be curious to investigate
  farther how some odd forms of expression of this kind have crept into, if
  not the English language, at least into every-day parlance; and by
  <i>what classes of men</i> they have been introduced. I do not of course
  mean the vile <i>argot</i>, or St. Giles' <!-- Page 618 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page618"></a>{618}</span> Greek, prevalent among
  housebreakers and pick-pockets; though a great deal of that is traceable
  to the Rommany or gipsy language, and other sufficiently odd sources: but
  I allude more particularly to phrases used by even educated
  men&mdash;such as "a regular mull," "bosh," "just the cheese," &amp;c.
  The first has already been proved an importation from our Anglo-Indian
  friends in the pages of "N. &amp; Q."; and I have been informed that the
  other two are also exotics from the land of the Qui-Hies. <i>Bosh</i>,
  used by us in the sense of "nonsense," "rubbish," is a Persian word,
  meaning "dirt" and <i>cheese</i>, a corruption of a Hindostani word
  denoting "thing:" which is exactly the sense of the expression I have
  quoted. "Just the cheese," "quite the cheese," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> just the
  thing I require, quite <i>comme il faut</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Probably some of your correspondents could furnish other examples.</p>

  <p>"<i>Quem Deus vult perdere.</i>"&mdash;In Croker's <i>Johnson</i>,
  vol. v. p. 60., the phrase, "Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat," is
  stated to be from a Greek <i>iambic</i> of Euripides:</p>

  Brickhill, Bucks<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, to Mr. Richard How of Aspley, Beds,
  and is taken for granted successively by Boswell, Malone, and Croker. But
  no such Greek is, in fact, to be found in Euripides; the words conveying
  a like sentiment are,&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The cause of this classical blunder of so many eminent annotators is,
  that these words are not to be found in the usual college and school
  editions of Euripides. The edition from which the above correct extract
  is made is in ten volumes, published at Padua in 1743-53, with an Italian
  translation in verse by P. Carmeli, and is to be found in vol. x. p. 268.
  as the 436-7th verses of the <i>Tragedie incerte</i>, the meaning of
  which he thus gives in prose "Quando vogliono gli Dei far perire alcuno,
  gli toglie la mente."</p>

  of the birthday of King James VIII. (the 10th of June), which was the
  Monday mentioned as that before the Saturday on which the newspaper was
  published. All faithful adherents of the House of Stuart showed their
  loyalty by wearing the white rose (its distinguishing badge) on the 10th
  of June, when no other way was left them of declaring their devotion to
  the exiled family; and, from my own knowledge, I can affirm that there
  still exist some people who would think that day desecrated unless they
  wore a white rose, or, when that is not to be procured, a cockade of
  white ribbon, in token of their veneration for the memory of him of whose
  birth it is the anniversary.</p>

  <p>In Shetland, at the present day, all public assessments are levied,
  and divisions made, according to the number of merk lands in a parish.
  All arable lands were anciently, under the Norwegian law, rated as
  <i>merks</i>,&mdash;a merk containing eight <i>ures</i>. These merks are
  quite indefinite as to extent. It is, indeed, clear that the ancient
  denomination of <i>merk land</i> had not reference to superficial extent
  of surface, but was a denomination of value alone, in which was included
  the proportion of the surrounding commonty or <i>scattald</i>. Merk lands
  are of different values, as sixpenny, ninepenny, twelvepenny,&mdash;a
  twelvepenny merk having, formerly at least, been considered equal to two
  sixpenny merks; and in some old deeds lands are described as thirty merks
  sixpenny, otherwise fifteen merks twelvepenny land. All assessments have,
  however, for a very long period, been levied and all privileges
  apportioned, according to merks, without relation to whether they were
  sixpenny or twelvepenny. The ancient rentals of Shetland contain about
  fourteen thousand merks of land; and it will be noticed that, however
  much the ancient inclosed land be increased by additional improvements,
  the number of merks ought to be, and are, stationary. The valued rent,
  divided according the merk lands, would make a merk land in Shetland
  equal to 2<i>l.</i> Scots of valued rent. There are only one or two
  places of Scotland proper where merks are in use,&mdash;Stirling and
  Dunfermline, I think. As these two places were the occasional residences
  of our ancient Scottish kings, it is possible this plan of estimating
  land may have obtained there, to equalise and make better understood some
  arrangements relating to land entered into between the kings of Norway
  and Scotland. Possibly some of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." in the
  north may be able to throw some light on this subject. It was stated some
  time ago that Dr. Munch, Professor in the University of Christiana, had
  presented to the Society of Northern Archæology, in <!-- Page 619
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page619"></a>{619}</span> Copenhagen, a
  very curious manuscript which he had discovered and purchased during a
  voyage to the Orkneys and Shetland in 1850. The manuscript is said to be
  in good preservation, and the form of the characters assigns the tenth,
  or perhaps the ninth century as its date. It is said to contain, in the
  Latin tongue, several episodes of Norwegian history, relating to
  important facts hitherto unknown, and which throw much light on feudal
  tenures, holdings, superstitions, omens, &amp;c., which have been handed
  down to our day, with their origin involved in obscurity, and on the
  darkness of the centuries that preceded the introduction of Christianity
  into Norway. Has this manuscript ever been printed?</p>

<h3>THE LEIGH PEERAGE, AND STONELEY ESTATES, WARWICKSHIRE.</h3>

  <p>The fifth Lord Leigh left his estates to his sister, the Hon. Mary
  Leigh, for her life, and at her decease without issue to "the first and
  nearest of his kindred, being male, and of his name and blood," &amp;c.
  On the death of Mrs. Mary Leigh in 1806, the estates were taken
  possession of by her very distant kinsman, the Rev. Thomas Leigh. The
  first person to dispute his right to them was Mr. George Smith Leigh, who
  claimed them as being descended from a <i>daughter</i> of Sir Thomas
  Leigh, son of the first Baron Leigh. His claim was not allowed, because
  he had the name of Leigh only <i>by royal license, and not by
  inheritance</i>. Subsequently, the Barony of Leigh was claimed by another
  Mr. George Leigh, of Lancashire, as descended from a son of the Hon.
  Christopher Leigh (fourth son of the aforesaid Sir Thomas Leigh), by his
  second wife. His claim was disallowed when heard by a committee of the
  House of Lords in 1828, because he could not prove the second marriage of
  Christopher Leigh, nor the birth of any son by such marriage.</p>

  <p>Being about to print a genealogy of the Leigh family, I should be
  under an obligation to any one who will, without delay furnish me
  with&mdash;</p>

  <p>1st. The descent, with dates, of the aforesaid Mr. George <i>Smith</i>
  Leigh from Sir Thomas Leigh.</p>

  <p>2nd. The wife, and descendants to the present time, of the aforesaid
  Mr. George Leigh.</p>

  <p>In return for this information I shall be happy to send my informant a
  copy of the genealogy when it is printed. I give you my name and
  address.</p>

  royal carriage is proceeding, drawn by six horses. On one side is a row

<h3>CORRESPONDENCE OF CRANMER AND CALVIN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 501.)</p>

  <p>The question put by C.&nbsp;D., respecting the existence of letters said to
  have passed between Archbishop Cranmer and Calvin, and to exist in print
  at Geneva, upon the seeming sanction given by our liturgy to the belief
  that baptism confers regeneration, is a revival of an inquiry made by
  several persons about ten years ago. It then induced M. Merle d'Aubigné
  to make the search of which C.&nbsp;D. has heard; and the result of that
  search was given in a communication from the Protestant historian to the
  editor of the <i>Record</i>, bearing date April 22, 1843.</p>

  <p>I have that communication before me, as a cutting from the
  <i>Record</i>; but have not preserved the date of the number in which it
  appeared<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>,
  though likely to be soon after its receipt by the editor. Merle d'Aubigné
  says, in his letter, that both the printed and manuscript correspondence
  of Calvin, in the public library of Geneva, had been examined in vain by
  himself, and by Professor Diodati the librarian, for any such topic; but
  he declares himself disposed to believe that the assertion, respecting
  which C. D. inquires, arose from the following passage in a letter from
  Calvin to the English primate:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Sic correctæ sunt externæ superstitiones, ut residui maneant innumeri
  surculi, qui assidue pullulent. <i>Imo ex corruptelis papatus audio
  relictum esse congeriem, quæ non obscuret modo, sed propemodum obruat
  purum et genuinum Dei cultum</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Part of this letter, but with important omissions, had been published
  by Dean Jenkyns in 1833. (<i>Cranmer's Remains</i>, vol. i. p. 347.) M.
  d'Aubigné's communication gave the whole of it; and it ought to have
  appeared in the Parker Society volume of original letters relative to the
  English Reformation. That volume contains one of Calvin's letters to the
  Protector Somerset; but omits another, of which Merle d'Aubigné's
  communication supplied a portion, containing this important sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Quod ad formulam precum et rituum ecclesiasticorum, <i>valde probo ut
  certa illa extet, a qua pastoribus discedere in functione sua non
  liceat</i>, tam ut consulatur quorumdam simplicitati et imperitiæ, quam
  ut certius ita constet omnium inter se ecclesiarum consensus."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another portion of a letter from Calvin, communicated by D'Aubigné, is
  headed in the <i>Record</i> "Cnoxo et gregalibus, S.&nbsp;D.;" but seems to be
  the one cited in the Parker Society, vol. ii. of <i>Letters</i>, pp.
  755-6, notes 941, as a letter to Richard Cox and others; so that
  <i>Cnoxo</i> should have been Coxo.</p>

  <p>The same valuable communication farther contained the letter of
  Cranmer inviting Calvin to unite with <span class="correction"
  title="'Malancthon' in original">Melancthon</span> and Bullinger in
  forming arrangements for holding a Protestant synod in some safe place;
  meaning in England, as he states more expressly to Melancthon. This
  letter, however, had been printed entire by Dean Jenkyns, vol. i. p.
  346.; and it is given, with an English translation, in the Parker Society
  edition of <i>Cranmer's Works</i> as Letter <span
  class="sc">ccxcvii.</span>, p. 431. It is important, as proving that
  Heylyn stated what was untrue, <i>Eccles. Restaur.</i>, p. 65.; where he
  has said, "Calvin had offered his assistance to Archbishop Cranmer. But
  the archbishop knew the man, and refused his offer." Instead of such an
  offer, Calvin replied courteously and affectionately to Cranmer's
  invitation; but says, "Tenuitatem meam facturam spero, ut mihi parcatur
  ... Mihi utinam par studii ardori suppeteret facultas." This reply, the
  longest letter in their correspondence, is printed in the note attached
  to Cranmer's letter (Park. Soc., as above, p. 432.; and a translation of
  it in Park. Soc. <i>Original Letters</i>, vol. ii. p. 711.: and there are
  extracts from it in Jenkyns, p. 346., n.p.). D'Aubigné gave it entire;
  but has placed both Calvin's letters to the archbishop before the
  latter's epistle to him, to which they both refer.</p>

<h3>"POPULUS VULT DECIPI."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 572.)</p>

  <p>If <span class="sc">Mr. Temple</span> will turn to p. 141. of Mathias
  Prideaux's <i>Easy and Compendious Introduction for reading all Sorts of
  Histories</i>, 6th edit., Oxford, 1682, small 4to., he will find his
  Query thus answered:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"It was this Pope's [Paul IV.] Legate, <i>Cardinal Carafa</i>, that
  gave this blessing to the devout Parisians, <i>Quandoquidem populus
  decipi vult, decipiatur</i>. Inasmuch as this people <i>will</i> be
  deceived, let them be deceived."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This book of Prideaux's is full of mottoes, of which I shall give a
  few instances. Of Frederick Barbarosa "his saying was, <i>Qui nescit
  dissimulare, nescit imperare</i>:" of Justinian "His word was, <i>Summum
  jus, summa injuria</i>&mdash;The rigour of the law may prove injurious to
  conscience:" of Theodosius II. "His motto was, <i>Tempori
  parendum</i>&mdash;We must fit us (as far as it may be done with a good
  conscience) to the time wherein we live, with Christian prudence:" of
  Nerva "His motto sums <!-- Page 622 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page622"></a>{622}</span> up his excellencies, <i>Mens bona regnum
  possidet</i>&mdash;My mind to me a kingdom is:" of Richard C&oelig;ur de
  Lion, "The motto of <i>Dieu et mon droit</i> is attributed to him;
  ascribing the victory he had at Gisors against the French, not to
  himself, but to God and His might."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Eirionnach.</span>

  <p>Cardinal Carafa seems to have been the author of the above memorable
  dictum. Dr. John Prideaux thus alludes to the circumstance:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Cardinalis (ut ferunt) quidam <span title="meta pollês phantasias" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#x1F70; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf;
  &phi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;&#x1F77;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>
  Lutetiam aliquando ingrediens, cum instant importunius turbæ ut
  benedictionem impertiret: <i>Quandoquidem</i> (inquit) <i>hic populus
  vult decipi, decipiatur in nomine Diaboli</i>."&mdash;<i>Lectiones
  Novem</i>, p. 54.: Oxoniæ, 1625, 4to.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I must also quote from Dr. Jackson:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Do all the learned of that religion in heart approve that commonly
  reported saying of Leo X., '<i>Quantum profuit nobis fabula Christi</i>,'
  and yet resolve (as Cardinal Carafa did, <i>Quoniam populus iste vult
  decipi, decipiatur</i>) to puzzle the people in their
  credulity?"&mdash;<i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 585.: Lond. 1673, fol.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The margin directs me to the following passage in Thuanus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Inde Carafa Lutetiam regni metropolim tanquam Pontificis legatus
  solita pompa ingreditur, ubi cum signum crucis, ut fit, ederet, verborum,
  quæ proferri mos est, loco, ferunt eum, ut erat securo de numine animo et
  summus religionis derisor, occursante passim populo et in genua ad ipsius

<h3>LATIN&mdash;LATINER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 423.)</p>

  <p>Latin was likewise used for the language or song of birds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"E cantino gli angelli</p>
      <p>Ciascuno in suo <i>Latino</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Dante</i>, canzone i.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This faire kinges doughter Canace,</p>
      <p>That on hire finger bare the queinte ring,</p>
      <p>Thurgh which she understood wel every thing</p>
      <p>That any foule may in his <i>leden</i> sain,</p>
      <p>And coude answere him in his <i>leden</i> again,</p>
      <p>Hath understonden what this faucon seyd."</p>
      <p class="i8">Chaucer, <i>The Squieres Tale</i>, 10746.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Chaucer, it will be observed, uses the Anglo-Saxon form of the word.
  <i>Leden</i> was employed by the Anglo-Saxons in the sense of language
  generally, as well as to express the Latin tongue.</p>

  <p>In the German version of Sir Tristram, Latin is also used for the song
  of birds, and is so explained by Ziemann:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"<i>Latin</i>, Latein; für jede fremde eigenthümliche Sprache, selbst
  für den <i>Vogelgesang</i>. Tristan und Isolt, 17365."&mdash;Ziemann,
  <i>Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Spenser, who was a great imitator of Chaucer, probably derives the
  word <i>leden</i> or <i>ledden</i> from him:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thereto he was expert in prophecies,</p>
      <p>And could the <i>ledden</i> of the gods unfold."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>The Faerie Queene</i>, book iv. ch. xi. st. 19.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And those that do to Cynthia expound</p>
      <p>The <i>ledden</i> of straunge languages in charge."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Colin Clout</i>, 744.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the last passage, perhaps, <i>meaning, knowledge</i>, best
  expresses the sense. <i>Ledden</i> may have been one of the words which
  led Ben Jonson to charge Spenser with "affecting the ancients." However,
  I find it employed by one of his cotemporaries, Fairfax:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"With party-colour'd plumes and purple bill,</p>
      <p class="i1">A wond'rous bird among the rest there flew,</p>
      <p>That in plain speech sung love-lays loud and shrill,</p>
      <p class="i1">Her <i>leden</i> was like human language true."</p>
      <p class="i8">Fairfax's <i>Tasso</i>, book xvi. st. 13.</p>

  <p>The expression <i>lede, in lede</i>, which so often occurs in Sir
  Tristram, may also have arisen from the Anglo-Saxon form of the word
  <i>Latin</i>. Sir W. Scott, in his Glossary, explains it: "<i>Lede, in
  lede. In language</i>, an expletive, synonymous to <i>I tell you</i>."
  The following are a few of the passages in which it is found:</p>

<h3>JACK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 326.)</p>

  <p>The list of <i>Jacks</i> supplied by your correspondent <span
  class="sc">John Jackson</span> is amusing and curious. A few additions
  towards a complete collection may not be altogether unacceptable or
  unworthy of notice.</p>

  <p>Supple (usually pronounced souple) <i>Jack</i>, a flexible cane;
  <i>Jack</i> by the hedge, a plant (<i>Erysimum cordifolium</i>); the
  <i>jacks</i> of a harpsichord; <i>jack</i>, an engine to raise ponderous
  bodies (Bailey); <i>Jack</i>, the male of birds of sport (Ditto);
  <i>Jack</i> of Dover, a joint twice dressed (Ditto, from Chaucer);
  <i>jack</i> pan, used by barbers (Ditto); <i>jack</i>, a frame used by
  sawyers. I have also noted <i>Jack</i>-Latin, <i>Jack</i>-a-nod, but
  cannot give their authority or meaning. <!-- Page 623 --><span

  <p>The term was very familiar to our older writers. The following to

  <p>Your correspondent is perhaps aware that Dr. Johnson is disposed to
  consider the derivation from <i>John</i> to be an error, and rather
  refers the word to the common usage of the French word Jacques (James).
  His conjecture seems probable, from many of its applications in this
  language. <i>Jacques</i>, a jacket, is decidedly French; <i>Jacques</i>
  de mailles equally so; and the word <i>Jacquerie</i> embraces all the
  catalogue of virtues and vices which we connect with our <i>Jack</i>.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, <i>John</i>, in his integrity, occurs familiarly in
  <i>John</i> Bull, <i>John</i>-a-Nokes, <i>John</i> Doe, <i>John</i>
  apple, <i>John</i> Doree, Blue <i>John</i>, <i>John</i> Trot,
  <i>John's</i> Wort, <i>John</i>-a-dreams, &amp;c.; and Poor <i>John</i>

<h3>PASSAGE IN ST. JAMES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 549)</p>

  <p>On referring to the passage cited by S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. in Bishop Taylor's
  <i>Holy Dying</i>, vol. iv. p. 345. (Heber's edit.), I find I had marked
  two passages in St. James's Epistle as being those to which, in all
  probability, the bishop alluded; one in the first chapter, and one in the
  third. In the commencement of his Epistle St. James exhorts his hearers
  to exercise patience in all the worldly accidents that might befal them;
  to resign themselves into God's hands, and accept in faith whatever might
  happen. He then proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"If any of you lack wisdom" (prudentia ad dijudicandum quid in
  singulis circumstantiis agendum sit&mdash;<i>Grotius</i>), "let him ask
  of God" (postulet ab eo, qui dat, nempe Deo: ut intelligas non aliunde
  petendum sapientiam.&mdash;<i>Erasmus</i>).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, in chap. iii. 13., he asks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you" (<span
  title="epistêmôn" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F75;&mu;&omega;&nu;</span>,
  <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> sciens, sive scientià præditus, quod recentiores vocant
  scientificus.&mdash;<i>Erasmus</i>).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He bids him prove his wisdom by submission to the truth; for that
  cunning craftiness which manifests itself only in generating heresies and
  contentions, is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Not from above," <span title="all' epigeios, Psuchikê " class="grk"
  >&#x1F00;&lambda;&lambda;'
  &#x1F10;&pi;&#x1F77;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
  &Psi;&upsilon;&chi;&iota;&kappa;&#x1F74; </span> (animalis,&mdash;ista
  sapientia a natura est, non a Deo) <span title="daimoniôdês" class="grk"
  >&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&#x1F7D;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>.&mdash;<i>Vid.</i>
  Eph. ii. 2., and 2 Cor. iv. 4.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These passages would naturally afford ample scope for the exuberant
  fancy of ancient commentators; and it is not unreasonable to suppose that
  Bishop Taylor may have had the remarks of one of these writers running in
  his mind, when he quoted St. James as reprobating, with such minuteness
  of detail, the folly of consulting oracles, spirits, sorcerers, and the
  like.</p>

  <p>I have not, at present, access to any of the commentators to whom I
  allude; so I am unable to confirm this suggestion.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.

  <p class="address">&mdash;&mdash; Rectory, Hereford.

  <p>There is no uncanonical epistle attributed to this apostle, although
  the one received by the English from the Greek and Latin churches was
  pronounced uncanonical by Luther. The passage to which Jeremy Taylor
  refers, is iv. 13, 14., which he interpreted as referring to an unlawful
  inquiry into the future:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into such a
  city and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: whereas
  ye know not what shall be on the morrow: for what is your life? It is
  even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth
  away."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Hug (Wait's Trans., vol. ii. p. 579.) considers the apostle as
  reproving the Jews for attempting to evade the national punishment
  threatened them, by removing out of their own country of Judæa. Probably,
  however, neither Taylor nor Hug are correct in departing from the more
  obvious signification, which refers to the mercantile character of the
  twelve tribes (i. 1.), arising mainly out of the fact of their
  captivities and dispersions (<span title="diasporai" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&alpha;&sigma;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&#x1FB7;</span>). The
  practice is still common in the East for merchants on a large and small
  scale to spend a whole season or year in trafficking in one city, and
  passing thence to another with the varied products suitable respectively
  to each city; and such products were interchanged without that extreme
  division of labour or despatch which the magnitude of modern commerce
  requires. The whole passage, from James iv. 13. to v. 6. inclusive, must
  be taken as specially applicable to the sins of mercantile men whose
  <i>works</i> of righteousness St. James (iii. 17-20.) declared to be
  wanting, in proof of their holding the <i>faith</i> necessary, <!-- Page
  624 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page624"></a>{624}</span>
  according, to St. Paul (Rom. iii. 27.), for their salvation.</p>

<h3>FAITHFULL TEATE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 529.)</p>

  <p>The <i>Ter Tria</i><a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, about which your correspondent
  J.&nbsp;S. inquires, is neither a rare nor a very valuable book; and if his
  copy has cost him more than some three and sixpence, it is a poor
  investment of capital. Mine, which is of the second edition, 1669, has
  the following book-note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The worthy Faithfull Teate indulges himself in the then prevailing
  bad taste of <i>anagramising</i> his name: see the result after the
  title. A better play upon his name is that of Jo. Chishull, who, in
  lashing the prophane wits of the day, and eulogising the author, has the
  following comical allusion thereto:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Let all wise-hearted sav'ring things divine</p>
      <p><i>Come suck this</i> <span class="sc">Teat</span> that yields both milk and wine,</p>
      <p>Loe depths where elephants may swim, yet here</p>
      <p>The weakest lamb of Christ wades without fear.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>The <i>Ter Tria</i> was originally published in 1658; its author,
  F.&nbsp;T., was the father of the better known Nahum Tate, the co-translator
  of the last authorised version of the Psalms,&mdash;a <i>Teat</i> which,
  following the metaphor of Mr. Chishull, has nourished not a few
  generations of the godly, but now, like a sucked orange, thrown aside for
  the more juicy productions of our modern Psalmists. Old Teate (or Tate,
  as the junior would have it) is styled in this book, "preacher at
  Sudbury." He seems subsequently to have removed to Ireland, where his son
  Nahum, the laureat, was born.</p>

<h3>PARVISE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 528.)</p>

  <p><i>Parvise</i> seems to have been a porch, used as a school or place
  for disputation. The <i>parvise</i> mentioned in the Oxford "Little-Go"
  (Responsions) Testamur is alluded to in Bishop Cooper's book against
  Private Mass (published by the Parker Society). He ridicules his
  opponent's arguments as worthy of "a sophister in the parvyse schools."
  The Serjeant-at-law, in Chaucer's Canterbury Pilgrims, had been often at
  the <i>paruise</i>. In some notes on this character in a number of the
  <i>Penny Magazine</i> for 1840 or 1841, it is farther remarked that the
  choristers of Norwich Cathedral were formerly taught in the
  <i>parvise</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> porch. The chamber over a porch in some
  churches may have been the school meant. Instances of this arrangement
  were to be found at Doncaster Church (where it was used as a library),
  and at Sherborne Abbey Church. The porch here was Norman, and the chamber
  Third Pointed; and at the restoration lately effected the pitch of the
  roof was raised, and the chamber removed.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">B. A. Oxon.</span>

  <p class="address">Oxford University.

  <p>I believe that the <i>parvisus</i>, or <i>paradisus</i> of the
  Responsions Testamur, is the <i>pro-scholium</i> of the divinity school,
  otherwise called the "pig-market," from its site having been so occupied
  up to the year 1554. This is said to be the locality in which the
  Responsions were formerly held.</p>

  <p>It is ordered by the statutes, tit. vi.,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Quod priusquam quis ad Gradum Baccalaurei in Artibus admittatur, in
  Parviso semel Quæstionibus Magistrorum Scholarum respondeat."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>However, they go on to direct, "Locus hisce Responsionibus assignetur
  Schola Metaphysices;" and there they are at present held. (See the
  Glossary to Tyrwhitt's <i>Chaucer</i>; and also Parker's <i>Glossary of
  Architecture</i>, ad voc. "Parvise.")</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Cheverells.</span>

  <p>The term <i>parvise</i>, though used in somewhat different senses by
  old writers, appears to mean strictly a <i>porch</i> or
  <i>antechamber</i>. Your correspondent <span class="sc">Oxoniensis</span>
  will find in Parker's <i>Glossary</i> ample information respecting this
  word, with references to various writers, showing the different meanings
  which have been attached to it. "Responsions," or the preliminary
  examinations at Oxford, are said to be held <i>in parviso</i>; that is,
  in the porch, as it were, or antechamber before the schools, which are
  the scene of the greater examinations for the degree.</p>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.

  <p>If your correspondent will refer to the word <i>Parvisium</i>, in the
  Glossary at the end of Watt's edition of Matthew Paris, he will find a
  good deal of information. To this I will add that the word is now in use
  in Belgium in another sense. I saw some years since, and again last
  summer, in a street leading out of the Grande Place, by one side of the
  Halle at Bruges, on a house, this notice,&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE C&OElig;NACULUM OF LIONARDO DA VINCI.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 524, 525.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Smirke</span>'s paper, questioning the received
  opinion as to the points of time and circumstance <!-- Page 625 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page625"></a>{625}</span> expressed in this
  celebrated fresco, contains the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The work in question is now so generally accessible, through the
  medium of <i>accurate</i> engravings, that any one may easily exercise
  his own judgment on the matter."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Having within no very distant period spent an hour or two in examining
  the original, with copies lying close at hand for the purposes of
  comparison, allow me to offer you a few impressions of which, while
  fresh, I "made a note" in an interleaved copy of Bishop Burnet's curious
  <i>Tour in Italy</i>, which served me as a journal while abroad. Burnet
  mentions the Dominican Convent at Milan as in his day "very rich." My
  note is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Dominican convent is now suppressed. It is a cavalry barracks:
  dragoons have displaced Dominicans. There is a fine cupola to the church,
  the work of Bramante: in the salle or refectory of this convent was
  discovered, since Burnet's time, under a coat of wash or plaster, the
  celebrated fresco of Lionardo da Vinci, now so well known to the world by
  plates and copies, better finished than the original ever was, in all
  probability; certainly better than it is now, after abuse, neglect, damp,
  and, worst of all, <i>restoring</i>, have done their joint work upon it.
  A visit to this fresco disenchants one wonderfully. It is better to be
  satisfied with the fine engravings, and let the original live in its
  ideal excellence. The copyists have taken some liberties, of which these
  strike me as the chief:</p>

  <p>"First, The Saviour's head is put more on one side, in what I would
  call a more languishing position than its actual one.</p>

  <p>"Second, the expression of the figure seated at his left hand is quite
  changed. In the copies it is a grave, serious, fine face: in the
  original, though now indistinct, it evidently expressed 'open-mouthed
  horror' at the declaration, 'One of you shall betray me.'</p>

  <p>"Third, Judas in all copies is identified not only by the held bag of
  money, but by the overturned saltcellar at his elbow. This last is not in
  the original.</p>

  <p>"The whole fresco, though now as well kept as may be, seems spoiling
  fast. There is a Crucifixion at the other end of the same hall, in much
  better preservation, though of the same date; and the doorway which the
  tasteful Dominicans cut in the wall, through the bottom of the painting,
  is, though blocked up, still quite visible. It is but too probable that
  the monks valued the absurd and hideous frescoes in the cloisters
  outside, representing Saint Dominic's miracles! and the Virgin fishing
  souls out of purgatory with a rosary, beyond Lionardo's great work."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So far my original note, written without supposing that the received
  idea, as to the subject of the picture, had ever been questioned. In
  reference to the question raised, however, I will briefly say, that, as
  recollection serves me, it would require a well-sustained criticism to
  convince me that the two disciples at the Saviour's right hand were not
  designed to express the point of action described in the 23rd and 24th
  verses of chapter xiii. of St. John's Gospel. Possibly <span
  class="sc">Mr. Smirke</span> might favour us with the argument of his
  MSS. on the group.</p>

<h3>BURN AT CROYDON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 238. 393.)</p>

  <p>The bourne at Croydon is one of the most remarkable of those
  intermitting springs which issue from the upper part of the chalk strata
  after long-continued rains.</p>

  <p>All porous earth-beds are reservoirs of water, and give out their
  supplies more or less copiously according to their states of engorgement;
  and at higher or lower levels, as they are more or less replenished by
  rain. Rain percolates through the chalk rapidly at all times, it being
  greatly fissured and cavernous, and finds vent at the bottom of the
  hills, in ordinary seasons, in the perennial springs which issue there,
  at the top of the chalk marl, or of the galt (the clay so called) which
  underlies the chalk. But when long-continued rains have filled the
  fissures and caverns, and the chinks and crannies of the ordinary vents
  below are unequal to the drainage, the reservoir as it were overflows,
  and the superfluity exudes from the valleys and gullies of the upper
  surface; and these occasional sources continue to flow till the
  equilibrium is restored, and the perennial vents suffice to carry off the
  annual supply. Some approach to the full engorgement here spoken of takes
  place annually in many parts of the chalk districts, where springs break
  out after the autumnal and winter rains, and run themselves dry again in
  the course of a few months, or maybe have intermissions of a year or two,
  when the average falls are short. Thence it is we have so many
  "Winterbournes" in the counties of Wilts, Hants, and Dorset; as
  Winterbourne-basset, Winterbourne-gunner, Winterbourne-stoke, &amp;c.
  (Vide Lewis's <i>Topog. Dict.</i>) The highest sources of the Test,
  Itchen, and some other of our southern rivers which take their rise in
  the chalk, are often dry for months, and their channels void of water for
  miles; failing altogether when the rains do not fill the neighbouring
  strata to repletion.</p>

  <p>In the case of long intermissions, such as occur to the Croydon
  bourne, it is not wonderful that the sudden appearance of waters in
  considerable force, where none are usually seen to flow, should give rise
  to superstitious dread of coming evils. Indeed, the coincidence of the
  running of the bourne, a wet summer, a worse sowing-season, and a wet
  cold spring, may well inspire evil forebodings, and give a colourable
  pretext for such apprehensions as are often entertained on the occurrence
  of any unusual natural phenomenon. These intermittent rivulets have no
  affinity, as your correspondent E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R. supposes, to subterraneous
  rivers. The nearest approach to this kind of stream is to be found in the
  Mole, which sometimes sinks away, and leaves its channel dry between
  Dorking and Leatherhead, being absorbed into fissures in the chalk, and
  again discharged; these fissures being insufficient to receive its waters
  in times of more copious supply. The subterraneous rivers of more
  mountainous countries are also not to be included in the same category.
  They have a history of their own, to enlarge on which is not the business
  of this Note: but it may not be irrelevant to turn the attention for a
  moment to the use of the word <i>bourne</i> or <i>burn</i>. The former
  mode of spelling and pronouncing it appears to prevail in the south, and
  the latter in the north of England and in Scotland; both alike from the
  same source as the <i>brun</i> or <i>brunen</i> of Germany. The perennial
  bourne so often affords a convenient natural geographical boundary, and a
  convenient line of territorial division, that by an easy metonymy it has
  established itself in our language in either sense, signifying streamlet
  or boundary-line,&mdash;as witness the well-known lines:</p>

<h3>CHRISTIAN NAMES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 406. 488, 489.)</p>

  <p>The opinion of your correspondents, that instances of persons having
  more than one Christian name before the last century are, at least, very
  rare, is borne out by the learned Camden, who, however, enables me to
  adduce two earlier instances of polyonomy than those cited by
  J.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;H.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Two Christian names," says he (<i>Remaines concerning Britaine</i>,
  p. 44.), "are rare in England, and I onely remember now his majesty, who
  was named Charles James, and the prince his sonne Henry Frederic; and
  among private men, Thomas Maria Wingfield, and Sir Thomas Posthumous
  Hobby."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The custom must have been still rare at the end of the eighteenth
  century, for, as we are informed by Moore in a note to his <i>Fudge
  Family in Paris</i> (Letter IV.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The late Lord C. (Castlereagh?) of Ireland had a curious theory about
  names; he held that <i>every</i> man with <i>three</i> names was a
  Jacobin. His instances in Ireland were numerous; Archibald Hamilton
  Rowan, Theobald Wolfe Tone, James Napper Tandy, John Philpot Curran,
  &amp;c.: and in England he produced as examples, Charles James Fox,
  Richard Brinsley <!-- Page 627 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page627"></a>{627}</span> Sheridan, John Horne Tooke, Francis
  Burdett Jones," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps the noble lord thought with Sterne in <i>Tristram Shandy</i>,
  though the <i>nexus</i> is not easy to discover, that "there is a strange
  kind of magic bias, which good or bad names irresistibly impose upon our
  character and conduct," or perhaps he had misread that controverted
  passage in Plautus (<i>Aulular.</i> Act II. Sc. 4.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tun' <i>trium literarum</i> homo</p>
      <p>Me vituperas? <i>Fur.</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The custom is now almost universal; and as, according to Camden
  (<i>Remaines, &amp;c.</i>, p. 96.),</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Shortly after the Conquest it seemed a disgrace for a gentleman to
  have but one single name, as the meaner sort and bastards had,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>so now, the <i>tria nomina nobiliorum</i> have become so common, as to
  render the epigram upon a certain M.&nbsp;L-P. Saint-Florentin, of almost
  universal applicability as a neat and befitting epitaph.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"On ne lui avait pas épargné," says the biographer of this gentleman
  (<i>Biographie Universelle</i>, tom. xxxix. p. 573.), "les épigrammes de
  son vivant; il en parut encore contre lui au moment de sa mort; en voici
  une:&mdash;</p>

<h3>WEATHER RULES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 522.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent J.&nbsp;A., <span class="sc">Jun.</span>, makes a Note
  and asks a question regarding a popular opinion prevalent in
  Worcestershire, on the subject of a "Sunday's moon," as being one very
  much addicted to rain. In Sussex that bad repute attaches to the moon
  that changes on Saturday:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A Saturday's moon,</p>
      <p>If it comes once in seven years, it comes too soon."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It may be hoped that the time is not far distant when a scientific
  meteorology will dissipate the errors of the traditional code now in
  existence. Of these errors none have greater or more extensive prevalence
  than the superstitions regarding the influence of the moon on the
  atmospheric phenomena of wet and dry weather. Howard, the author of
  <i>The Climate of London</i>, after twenty years of close observation,
  could not determine that the moon had any perceptible influence on the
  weather. And the best authorities now follow, still more decidedly, in
  the same train.</p>

  <p>"The change of the moon," the expression in general use in predictions
  of the weather, is idly and inconsiderately used by educated people,
  without considering that in every phase that planet is the same to us, as
  a material agent, except as regards the power of reflected light; and no
  one supposes that moonlight produces wet or dry. Why then should that
  point in the moon's course, which we agree to call "the new" when it
  begins to emerge from the sun's rays, have any influence on our weather.
  Twice in each revolution, when in conjunction with the sun at new, and in
  opposition at the full, an atmospheric spring-tide may be supposed to
  exist, and to exert some sort of influence. But the existence of any
  atmospheric tide at all is denied by some naturalists, and is at most
  very problematical; and the absence of regular diurnal fluctuations of
  the barometric pressure favours the negative of this proposition. But,
  granting that it were so, and that the moon, in what is conventionally
  called the beginning of its course, and again in the middle, at the full,
  did produce changes in the weather, surely the most sanguine of
  <i>rational lunarians</i> would discard the idea of one moon differing
  from another, except in relation to the season of the year; or that a new
  moon on the Sabbath day, whether Jewish or Christian, had any special
  quality not shared by the new moons of any other days of the week.</p>

  <p>Such a publication as "N. &amp; Q." is not the place to discuss fully
  the question of lunar influence. Your correspondent J.&nbsp;A., <span
  class="sc">Jun.</span>, and all persons who have inconsiderately taken up
  the popular belief in moon-weather, will do well to consult an
  interesting article on this subject (I believe attributed to Sir D.
  Brewster) in <i>The Monthly Chronicle</i> for 1838; and this will also
  refer such inquirers to Arago's <i>Annuaire</i> for 1833. There may be
  later and completer disquisitions on the lunar influences, but they are
  not known to me.</p>

<h3>ROCOCO.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. i., pp. 321. 356.)</p>

  <p>This word is now receiving a curious illustration in this colony of
  French origin. <i>Rococo</i>&mdash;antiquated, old-fashioned&mdash;would
  seem to have become <i>rococo</i> itself; and in its place the negroes
  have adopted the word <i>entêté</i>, wilful, headstrong, to express, as
  it were, the persistence of a person in retaining anything that has gone
  out of fashion. This term was first applied to white hats; and the
  wearers of such have been assailed from every corner of the streets with
  the cry of "Entêté chapeau!" It was next applied to umbrellas of a <!--
  Page 628 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page628"></a>{628}</span>
  strange colour (the varieties of which are almost without number in this
  country of the sun); and it has now been extended to every article of
  wearing apparel of an unfashionable or peculiar shape. A negro woman,
  appearing with a blue umbrella, has been followed by half a dozen black
  boys with the cry of "Entêté parasol!" and in order to get rid of the
  annoyance she had to shut the umbrella and continue her way under the
  broiling sun. But the term is not always used in derision. A few days
  ago, a young girl of colour, dressed in the extreme of the fashion, was
  passing along, when some bystanders began to rally her with the word
  "Entêté." The girl, perceiving that she was the object of their notice,
  turned round, and in an attitude of conscious irreproachableness,
  retorted with the challenge in Creole French, "Qui entêté ça?" But the
  smiles with which she was greeted showed her (what she had already partly
  suspected) that their cries of "Entêté" were intended rather to
  compliment her on the style of her dress.</p>

<h3>DESCENDANTS OF JOHN OF GAUNT.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 41.)</p>

  <p>I am gratified to see that <span class="sc">Mr. Hardy</span>'s
  documentary researches have confirmed my conjectures as to the erroneous
  date assigned for the death of the first husband of Jane Beaufort.
  Perhaps it may be in his power also to rectify a chronological error,
  which has crept into the account usually given of the family into which
  one of her sons married. The Peerages all place the death of the last
  Lord Fauconberg of the original family in 1376, not observing that this
  date would make his daughter and heiress married to William Nevill,
  second son of the Earl of Westmoreland and Countess Joane, twenty-five
  years at the lowest computation; or, if we take the date which they
  assign for the death of Lord Ferrers of Wemme, forty years older than her
  husband,&mdash;a difference this, which, although perhaps it might not
  prove an insuperable impediment to marriage where the lady was a great
  heiress, would undoubtedly put a bar on all hopes of issue: whereas it
  stands on record that they had a family.</p>

  <p>I must take this opportunity of complaining of the manner in which
  many, if not all these Peerages, are compiled: copying each others'
  errors, however obvious, without a word of doubt or an attempt to rectify
  them; though <span class="sc">Mr. Hardy</span>'s communication, above
  mentioned, shows that the materials for doing so, in many cases, exist if
  properly sought. Not to mention minor errors, they sometimes crowd into a
  given time more generations than could have possibly existed, and
  sometimes make the generations of a length that has not been witnessed
  since the patriarchal ages. As instances of the former may be mentioned,
  the pedigree of the Ferrerses, Earls of Derby (in which eight successions
  from father to son are given between 1137 and 1265), and those of the
  Netterville and Tracy families: and of the latter, the pedigree of the
  Fitzwarines, which gives only four generations between the Conquest and
  1314; and that of the Clanricarde family. It is strange that Mr. Burke,
  who appears to claim descent from the latter, did not take more pains to
  rectify a point so nearly concerning him; instead of making, as he does
  in his Peerage, one of the family to have held the title (MacWilliam
  Eighter) and estates for 105 years!&mdash;an absurdity rendered still
  more glaring by this long-lived gentleman's father having possessed them
  fifty-four years before him, and his son for fifty-six years after him.
  If such can be supposed true, the Countess of Desmond's longevity was not
  so unusual after all.</p>

<h3>THE ORDER OF ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 407.)</p>

  <p>May I be allowed to inform your correspondent R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;P. that he is in
  error, when supposing that the English knights were deprived of their
  property by Queen Elizabeth, as it was done by act of parliament in the
  year 1534, and during the reign of Henry VIII.</p>

  <p>For the information sought by your correspondent R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;P., I would
  refer him to the following extract taken from Sutherland's <i>History of
  the Knights of Malta</i>, vol. ii. pp. 114, 115.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"To increase the despondency of L'Isle Adam [the Grand Master of the
  Order of St. John of Jerusalem], Henry VIII. of England having come to an
  open rupture with the Pope, in consequence of the Pontiff's steady
  refusal to countenance the divorcement of Catherine of Arragon his queen,
  commenced a fierce and bloody persecution against all persons in his
  dominions, who persisted in adhering to the Holy See. In these
  circumstances, the Knights of St. John, who held themselves bound to
  acknowledge the Pope as their superior at whatever hazard, did not long
  escape his ire. The power of the Order, composed as it was of the
  chivalry of the nation, while the Prior of London sat in parliament on an
  equality with the first baron of the realm, for a time deterred him from
  openly proscribing it; but at length his wrath burst forth in an
  ungovernable flame. The knights Ingley, Adrian Forrest, Adrian Fortescu,
  and Marmaduke Bohus, refusing to abjure their faith, perished on the
  scaffold. Thomas Mytton and Edward Waldegrave died in a dungeon; and
  Richard and James Bell, John Noel, and many others, abandoned their
  country for ever, and sought an asylum at Malta<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, completely stripped <!-- Page 629
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page629"></a>{629}</span> of their
  possessions. In 1534, by an act of the legislature, the Order of St. John
  was abolished in the King of England's dominions; and such knights as
  survived the persecution, but who refused to stoop to the conditions
  offered them, were thrown entirely on the charity of their brethren at
  Malta. Henry offered Sir Wm. Weston, Lord Prior of England, a pension of
  a thousand pounds a year; but that knight was so overwhelmed with grief
  at the suppression of his Order, that he never received a penny, but soon
  after died. Other knights, less scrupulous, became pensioners of the
  crown."</p>

  <p><i>"Dimidiation" in Impalements</i> (Vol. vii., p. 548.).&mdash;In
  reply to your correspondent's Query as to <i>dimidiation</i>, he will
  find that this was the most ancient form of impalement. Its manifest
  inconvenience no doubt at last banished it. Guillim (ed. 1724) says, at
  p. 425.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"It was an ancient way of impaling, to take half the husband's coat,
  and with that to joyn as much of the wife's; as appeareth in an old roll,
  wherein three lions, being the arms of <i>England</i>, are dimidiated and
  impaled with half the pales of Arragon. The like hath been practised with
  quartered coats by leaving out half of them."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On p. 426. he gives the example of Mary, Henry VIII.'s sister, and her
  husband Louis XII. of France. Here the French king's coat is cut in half,
  so that the lily in the base point is <i>dimidiated</i>; and the queen's
  coat, being quarterly France and England, shows two quarters only;
  England in chief, France in base.</p>

  <p>Sandford, in his <i>Genealogical History</i>, gives a plate of the
  tomb of Henry II. and Richard I. of England at Fontevrault, which was
  built anew in <!-- Page 630 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page630"></a>{630}</span> 1638. Upon it are several impalements by
  <i>dimidiation</i>. Sandford (whose book seems to me to be strangely
  over-valued) gives no explanation of them. No doubt they were copied from
  the original tomb.</p>

  <p>In Part II. of the <i>Guide to the Architectural Antiquities in the
  Neighbourhood of Oxford</i>, at p. 178., is figured an impalement by
  <i>dimidiation</i> existing at Stanton Harcourt, in the north transept of
  the church, in a brass on a piece of blue marble. The writer of the
  <i>Guide</i> supposes this bearing to be some union of Harcourt and Beke,
  in consequence of a will of John Lord Beke, and to be commemorative of
  the son of Sir Richard Harcourt and Margaret Beke. It is in fact
  commemorative of those persons themselves. Harcourt, two bars, is
  dimidiated, and meets Beke, a cross moline or ancrée. The figure thus
  produced is a strange one, but perfectly intelligible when the practice
  of impaling by dimidiation is recollected. I know no modern instance of
  this method of impaling. I doubt if any can be found since the time of
  Henry VIII.</p>

  quoted by J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;B.; but what at first struck me as most peculiar in
  common conversation, was the use, or rather abuse, of the little
  preposition <i>to</i>. When inquiring the whereabouts of an individual,
  Devonians ask one another, "Where is he <i>to</i>?" The invariable reply
  is, "<i>To</i> London," "<i>To</i> Plymouth," &amp;c., as the case may
  be. The Cheshire clowns, on the other hand, murder the word <i>at</i>, in
  just the same strange and inappropriate manner.</p>

  <p>The indiscriminate use of the term <i>forrell</i>, when describing the
  cover of a book, is a solecism, I fancy, peculiarly Devonian. Whether a
  book be bound in cloth, vellum, or morocco, it is all alike
  <i>forrell</i> in Devonshire parlance. I imagine, however, that the word,
  in its present corrupt sense, must have originated from <i>forrell</i>, a
  term still used by the trade to designate an inferior kind of vellum <!--
  Page 631 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page631"></a>{631}</span> or
  parchment, in which books are not unfrequently bound. When we consider
  that vellum was at one time in much greater request for bookbinding
  purposes than it is just now, we shall be at no great loss to reconcile
  this eccentricity in the vocabulary of our west country brethren.</p>

  <p><i>Humbug</i> (Vol. vii., p. 550.).&mdash;A recent number of Miller's
  <i>Fly Leaves</i> makes the following hazardous assertion as to the
  origin and derivation of the term <i>Humbug</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This, now common expression, is a corruption of the word Hamburgh,
  and originated in the following manner:&mdash;During a period when war
  prevailed on the Continent, so many false reports and lying bulletins
  were fabricated at Hamburgh, that at length, when any one would signify
  his disbelief of a statement, he would say, 'You had that from Hamburgh;'
  and thus, 'That is Hamburgh,' or <i>Humbug</i>, became a common
  expression of incredulity."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With all my credulity, I cannot help fancying that this bit of
  specious <i>humbug</i> is a <i>leetle</i> too far-fetched.</p>

  <p><i>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto</i> (Vol. vii., p. 551.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Inquirens</span> will find the passage he quotes in Congreve's
  <i>Love for Love</i>, Act II. Sc. 5. Foresight, addressing Sir Sampson
  Legend, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Thou modern Mandeville, Ferdinand Mendez Pinto was but a type,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the <i>Tatler</i>, No. 254. (a paper ascribed to Addison and Steele
  conjointly), these veracious travellers are thus pleasantly noticed:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"There are no books which I more delight in than in travels,
  especially those that describe remote countries, and give the writer an
  opportunity of showing his parts without incurring any danger of being
  examined and contradicted. Among all the authors of this kind, our
  renowned countryman, Sir John Mandeville, has distinguished himself by
  the copiousness of his invention, and the greatness of his genius. The
  second to Sir John I take to have been Ferdinand Mendez Pinto, a person
  of infinite adventure and unbounded imagination. One reads the voyages of
  these two great wits with as much astonishment as the travels of Ulysses
  in Homer, or of the Red Cross Knight in Spenser. All is enchanted ground
  and fairy land."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Biographical sketches of Mandeville and Pinto are attached to this
  paper in the excellent edition of the <i>Tatler</i> ("with Illustrations
  and Notes" by Calder, Percy, and Nichols), published in six volumes in
  1786. Godwin selected this quotation from Congreve as a fitting motto for
  his <i>Tale of St. Leon</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">J. H. M.

  <p>The passage referred to occurs in Congreve's <i>Love for Love</i>, Act
  II. Sc. 5. Cervantes had before designated Pinto as the "prince of
  liars." It seems that poor Pinto did not deserve the ill language applied
  to him by the wits. Ample notices of his travels may be seen in the
  <i>Retrospective Review</i>, vol. viii. pp. 83-105., and Macfarlane's
  <i>Romance of Travel</i>, vol. ii. pp. 104-192.</p>

  <p><i>"Other-some" and "Unneath"</i> (Vol vii., p. 571.).&mdash;Mr.
  Halliwell, in his <i>Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words</i>, has
  <i>other-some</i>, some other, "a quaint but pretty phrase <i>of frequent
  occurrence</i>." He gives two instances of its use. He has also
  "<i>Unneath</i>, beneath. Somerset."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">C. H. Cooper.</span>

  <p class="address">Cambridge.

  <p>The word <i>other-some</i> occurs in the authorised version of the
  Bible, Acts xvii. 18. "Other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of
  strange gods." It does not occur in any of the earlier versions of this
  passage in Bagster's <i>English Hexapla</i>. Halliwell says that it is "a
  quaint but pretty phrase of frequent occurrence," and gives an example
  dated 1570. <i>Unneath</i>, according to the same authority, is used in
  Somersetshire. <i>Other-some</i> is constantly used in Norfolk. I think
  it, however, a pity that your space should be occupied by such Queries as
  these, which a simple reference to Halliwell's <i>Dictionary</i> would
  have answered.</p>

  <p><i>Willow Pattern</i> (Vol. vi., p. 509.).&mdash;Evidently a Chinese

  of perspective. I have seen crockery in the shops in Shanghai with the
  <i>same pattern</i>, or at least with very slight difference.</p>

  that the word <i>pile</i> is of French origin: <!-- Page 632 --><span

  that side of the coin which bears the head. Cross or pile, a

  Kelham of Lincoln's Inn: London, 1779, 8vo., p. 183.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="grk">&Phi;</span>.

  <p><i>Old Fogie</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 354. 559.).&mdash;J. L., who writes
  from Edinburgh, denies the Irish origin of this appellation, because he
  says it was used of the "veteran companies" who garrisoned the castles of
  Edinburgh and Stirling. My mother, who was born in 1759, often told me
  that she never had heard any other name for the old men in the Royal
  Hospital, in the vicinity of which she passed her early days. It was
  therefore a well-known name a century ago in Dublin, and consequently was
  in use long before; probably from the building of the hospital in the
  reign of Charles II. Can J.&nbsp;L. trace the Scotch term as far back as that?
  Scotch or Irish, however, I maintain that my derivation is the right one.
  J.&nbsp;L. says he prefers that of Dr. Jamieson, in his <i>Scottish
  Dictionary</i>, who "derives it from Su.-G. <i>Fogde</i>, formerly one
  who had the charge of a garrison." In thus preferring a Scottish
  authority, J.&nbsp;L. shows himself to be a true Scot; but he must allow me to
  ask him, is he acquainted with the Swedish language? (for that is what is
  meant by the mysterious Su.-G.) And if so, is he not aware that
  <i>Fogde</i> is the same as the German <i>Vogt</i>, and signifies
  governor, judge, steward, &amp;c., never merely a military commandant;
  and what on earth has that to do with battered old soldiers?</p>

  <p>I may as well take this opportunity of replying to another of your
  Caledonian correspondents, respecting the origin of the word
  <i>nugget</i>. The Persian derivation is simply ridiculous, as the word
  was not first used in Australia. I am then perfectly well aware that this
  term has long been in use in Scotland and the north of Ireland as
  <i>i.&nbsp;q.</i> lump, as a <i>nugget</i> of bread, of sugar, &amp;c. But an
  <i>ingot</i> is a lump also: and the derivation is so simple and natural,
  that in any case I am disposed to regard it as the true one. May not the
  Yankee term have been made independently of the British one?</p>

  <p><i>Another odd Mistake</i> (Vol. vii., p. 405.).&mdash;On page 102. of

  defiance thrown out to Henry III. by his barons, <i>Nolumus leges Angliæ
  mutare</i>." I have never read of any such defiance, expressed in any
  such language, anywhere else.</p>

  <p><i>Spontaneous Combustion</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 286. 440.).&mdash;I have
  somewhere read an account of a drunkard whose body was so saturated with
  alcohol, that being bled in a fever, and the lamp near him having been
  overthrown, the blood caught fire, and burst into a blaze: the account
  added, that he was so startled by this occurrence, that on his recovery
  he reformed thoroughly, and prolonged his life to a good old age. Where
  is this story to be found, and is the fact related physically possible?
  It seems to bear on the question of spontaneous combustion.</p>

  <p><i>Erroneous Forms of Speech</i> (Vol vii., p. 329.).&mdash;E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R.
  will find, on farther inquiry, that he is in the wrong as regards the
  mode of writing and speaking <i>mangold-wurzel</i>. The subject was
  discussed in the <i>Gardeners' Chronicle</i> in 1844. There (p. 204.)
  your correspondent will find, by authority of "a German," that
  <i>mangold</i> is field-beet or leaf-beet: and that <i>mangel</i> is a
  corruption or pretended emendation of the common German appellation, and
  most probably of English coinage. Such a thing as <i>mangel-wurzel</i> is
  not known on the Continent; and the best authorities now, in this
  country, all use <i>mangold-wurzel</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">M.

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above, I have seen <span class="sc">Mr.
  Frere</span>'s note on the same subject (Vol. vii, p. 463.). The
  substitution of <i>mangel</i> for the original <i>mangold</i>, was
  probably an attempt to correct some vulgar error in orthography; or to
  substitute a word of some significance for one of none. But, as Dr.
  Lindley has said, "If we adopt a foreign name, we ought to take it as we
  find it, whatever may be its imperfections."</p>

  <p><i>Ecclesia Anglicana</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 12. 440. 535.).&mdash;I
  gladly set down for G.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;M. the following instances of the use of
  "Ecclesia Gallicana;" they are quotations occurring in Richard's
  <i>Analysis Consiliorum</i>: he will find many more in the same work as
  translated by Dalmasus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ex <i>Gallicanæ Ecclesiæ</i> usu, Jubilæi Bullæ ad Archiepiscopos
  mittendæ sunt, e quorum manibus ad suffraganeos Episcopos
  perferuntur."&mdash;<i>Monumenta Cleri</i>, tom. ii. p. 228.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gallicana Ecclesia</i> a disciplinæ remissione, ante quadringentos
  aut quingentos annos inducta, se melius quam aliæ defendit, Romanæque
  curiæ ausis vehementius resistat."&mdash;Fleurius, <i>Sermo super
  Ecclesiæ Gallicanæ Libertatibus</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have not time to search for the other examples which he wants;
  though I have not any doubt but they would easily be found. The English
  Church has been, I consider, a more Romanising church than many; but, in
  mediæval times, the most intimate connexion with Rome did not destroy,
  though it impaired, the nationality of the church. The church of Spain
  is, I believe, now one of the most national of the churches in communion
  with Rome.</p>

  <p><i>Popular Sayings.&mdash;The Sparrows at Lindholme</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  234.).&mdash;The sparrows at Lindholme have made themselves scarce here,
  under the following circumstances:&mdash;William of Lindholme seems to
  have united in himself the characters of hermit and wizard. When a boy,
  his parents, on going to Wroot Feast, hard by, left him to keep the
  sparrows from the corn; at which he was so enraged that he took up an
  enormous stone, and threw it at the house to which they were gone, but
  from throwing it too high it fell on the other side. After he had done
  this he went to the feast, and when scolded for it, said he had fastened
  up all the sparrows in the barn; where they were found, on the return
  home, all dead, except a few which were turned white. (Vide Stonehouse's
  <i>History of the Isle of Axholme</i>.)</p>

  Raol Tesson "<i>Tur aie</i>;" on which there is a note that M. Pluquet
  reads "Thor aide," which he considers may have been derived from the

  <p><b>SPECTACLES.</b>&mdash;WM. ACKLAND applies his medical knowledge as
  a Licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company, London, his theory as a
  Mathematician, and his practice as a Working Optician, aided by Smee's
  Optometer, in the selection of Spectacles suitable to every derangement
  of vision, so as to preserve the sight to extreme old age.</p>

  <p>ACHROMATIC TELESCOPES, with the New Vetzlar Eye-pieces, as exhibited
  at the Academy of Sciences in Paris. The Lenses of these Eye-pieces are
  so constructed that the rays of light fall nearly perpendicular to the
  surface of the various lenses, by which the aberration is completely
  removed; and a telescope so fitted gives one-third more magnifying power
  and light than could be obtained by the old Eye-pieces. Prices of the
  various sizes on application to WM. ACKLAND, Optician, 93. Hatton Garden,

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2¼ per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>
